This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "A Consensus-ADMM Approach for Strategic Generation Investment in Electricity Markets" to be submitted to the 57th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2018) . This is a joint work by Vladimir Dvorkin, Jalal Kazempour, Pierre Pinson from the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Technical University of Denmark and Luis Baringo from the School of Industrial Engineering of Universidad de Castilla La Mancha.

This repository provides the following materials:
1. GAMS code to solve the extensive MILP formulation of the strategic investment problem (Extensive.gms)
2. GAMS code to solve the strategic investment problem with the proposed consensus-ADMM algorithm (ADMM.gms)
3. Data to the case study in both GAMS codes
